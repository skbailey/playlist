Playlist Project 
========

A project that demonstrates my favorite tools on the front-end and backend
--------


It's a playlist app.  Create playlists of songs you like.  CRUD functionality allows you to create
a playlist, edit its title, delete the playlist and see all playlists.  You can add and remove songs from
a playlist.  

I build it in about 21 non-consecutive hours. Check out the git log when you clone the project.



Front end stack
--------

* CoffeeScript
* Underscore.js (Great library for utility functions)
* Backbone.js (Front End MVC)
* Require.js (Modular JavaScript Library)
* Handlebars.js (Templating)
* Grunt.js (Project Builds)


Back end stack
--------

* Node.js
* MongoDB


### Getting Started (for OSX)

 * Install mongodb: brew install mongodb
 * Run mongodb in Terminal: mongod
 * Clone repo and install packages: npm install
 * Run server: npm start
 
### What's missing?

  * Tests (Jasmine for front end, Cucumber.js for integration)
